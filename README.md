# Sentiment-Analyzer_Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-with-NLP-Models.

Natural language processing can be used to build predictive models to perform sentiment analysis on social media posts and reviews and predict if customers are happy or not. Natural language processors work by converting words into numbers and training a machine learning models to make predictions. That way, you can automatically know if your customers are happy or not without manually going through massive number of tweets or reviews!

The Objective of this project is to predict whether their customers are satisfied with the product or not based on the reviews (in text format).
